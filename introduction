In the world of development, where technologies like AI, machine learning, automation, web development are taking over, the demand of 
programmers and development professionals are increasing at the same rate. What if we had only one programming language which can feed
these wide range of demand and much more? Wouldn’t it be great? Yes, the answer is Python. With its incredible rate of growth over the 
years Python has become one of the most useful programming languages in 2018. With a very little exposure of computer programming and 
some mathematics knowledge one’s ready to get on board with this simple yet powerful high-level programming.

Growth rate of Python along with other programming languages are displayed above(Source: Stack Overflow).  
Simple and straight forward syntaxes make Python very user friendly. Where developers can focus on problem solving rather than syntax 
errors solving. Let’s get started with our first Python program,” Hello World”. 
Step1: Open Python Interactive Shell (editor)
Step2: Type: Print (“Hello World”)
Step3: Save the file (say, helloWorld.py)
Step4: Execute it
Python has various datatypes like,
•	Numbers: Integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers; e.g.: a=2, b=2.0, c=1+2j belongs to Number datatypes.
•	Lists: An ordered sequence of items; e.g.: a=[1,2,3,’Word’].
•	Tuples: An ordered sequence of items like lists but immutable; e.g.: a=(1,2,4).
•	Strings: A sequence of Unicode characters; e.g.: a=”New String”.
•	Sets: An unordered collection of unique items. e.g.: a={2,3,4,5}) and 
•	Dictionary: An unordered collection of Key-Value Pairs; e.g.: {‘a’: [1,2],’b’: [4,6]}, here a and b are Keys and [1,2] and [4,6] are 
their respective values 
Like other programming languages Python too has flow control methods such as,
•	If-else
•	For loop
•	While loop
•	Break and continue
•	Pass
Further to help our program break into smaller parts Python offers Functions, which make the program manageable and more organized. 
Function argument, function recursion and anonymous function lambda are a few facilities that comes under this segment.
Not to forget the File Operations which comes in handy while performing read/write operations with previously stored files. Here we use 
Python built in function open() to open a file and specify modes such as read/writewith r,w, r+ etc.
	e.g. >> fp=open(“filename.txt”, r), here file is opened to read only.
Apart from its simplicity and flexibility one of the most useful features of Python is that it allows programmers to take different 
programming approach.“Object Oriented Programming” tops the list. The idea behind solving a problem with OOP is that we create objects 
based upon their attributes and behavior, with reusability. For example, Pen is an object. Its attributes would be color, weight,grip 
and writing would be a behavior of Pen. 
•	Inheritance
•	Polymorphism and
•	Encapsulation are three basic principles of OOP
Here comes the concept of class and object. A class is called the “the blueprint” for the objects. Use of class and object are widely 
used in Python OOP. Although unlike other programming languages(e.g.: Java), Python doesn’t force users to define classes. 
This high level interpreted programming language is backed up by a large community of people who are continuously contributing towards 
its growth. According to reports, they have uploaded more than 145,000 custom-built software packages to the online repository, covering
everything from Game Development to Business Applications. Python has an extensive range of standard libraries contains built in modules
that offers facilities such as file handing, standardized solution of problems faced by developers every day.
Future aspects of python are very evident as the world today is dealing with rapid growth of data. Data science, data mining and Machine
learning are a few terms related to processing and handling data.
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	SciPy
•	Matplotlib 
These are a few examples Python libraries which helps in manipulation, analyze and visualize data.
Thus, to conclude, with the rise of Data Science and Machine Learning,Python experienced a very high rate of growth in the last decade.
