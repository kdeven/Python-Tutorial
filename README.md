In the world of development, where technologies like AI, machine learning, automation, web development are taking over, the demand of 
programmers and development professionals are increasing at the same rate. What if we had only one programming language which can feed
these wide range of demand and much more? Wouldn’t it be great? Yes, the answer is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ3IPRqiD2M">Python</a>. With its incredible rate of growth over the 
years Python has become one of the most useful programming languages in 2018. With a very little exposure of computer programming and 
some mathematics knowledge one’s ready to get on board with this simple yet powerful high-level programming. Python is one of the most used programming language and one can master it with

Growth rate of Python along with other programming languages are displayed above(Source: Stack Overflow).  
Simple and straight forward syntaxes make Python very user friendly. Where developers can focus on problem solving rather than syntax 
errors solving. Let’s get started with our first Python program,” Hello World”. 
Step1: Open Python Interactive Shell (editor)
Step2: Type: Print (“Hello World”)
Step3: Save the file (say, helloWorld.py)
Step4: Execute it
Python has various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">datatypes</a> like,
•	Numbers: Integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers; e.g.: a=2, b=2.0, c=1+2j belongs to Number datatypes.
•	Lists: An ordered sequence of items; e.g.: a=[1,2,3,’Word’].
•	Tuples: An ordered sequence of items like lists but immutable; e.g.: a=(1,2,4).
•	Strings: A sequence of Unicode characters; e.g.: a=”New String”.
•	Sets: An unordered collection of unique items. e.g.: a={2,3,4,5}) and 
•	Dictionary: An unordered collection of Key-Value Pairs; e.g.: {‘a’: [1,2],’b’: [4,6]}, here a and b are Keys and [1,2] and [4,6] are 
their respective values 
Like other programming languages Python too has flow control methods such as,
•	If-else
•	For loop
•	While loop
•	Break and continue
•	Pass
Further to help our program break into smaller parts Python offers Functions, which make the program manageable and more organized. 
Function argument, function recursion and anonymous function lambda are a few facilities that comes under this segment.
Not to forget the File Operations which comes in handy while performing read/write operations with previously stored files. Here we use 
Python built in function open() to open a file and specify modes such as read/writewith r,w, r+ etc.
	e.g. >> fp=open(“filename.txt”, r), here file is opened to read only.
